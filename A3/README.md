### What are Pokemon?
Pokemon are creatures of different shapes and sizes who 
live alongside humans. They typically do not speak English and communicate
by uttering their names; however, there are some exceptions (Example: Meowth can speak English). 
Throughout the years, Pokemon have been raised by their owners (also known as Trainers) to evolve 
and grow into stronger Pokemon.

### Pokemon in Assignment 3
I have based my assignment on Pokemon, after having played it for over 10 years.
In particular, this assignment is based off Pokemon Ruby - a variation where the user 
begins in a specific region. Ultimately, the goal of this game is to defeat all 
Pokemon encountered and become the best trainer of them all! 

I hope you enjoy looking over my assignment and please let me know if you have any questions!
